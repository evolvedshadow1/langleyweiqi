        <h2> Jack Zheng | 1-Dan</h2>
        <h4> Founder and Marketing Director</h4>
        <p> Jack was born in Jilin, China. He moved to Canada with his wife and son in 2006 to start a new chapter in life. Ever since he was a teenage, he has always been passionate about
        the game of Weiqi. When he arrived to Langley, he was surprised that there was not a big community supporting Weiqi. With that in mind, he decided to start the Langley Weiqi Association.
      Through the association, he hopes to show people of all ages the fun, strategic, and interesting game of Weiqi. </p>
